# Sam Stoia Portfolio

This is my Capstone project, which will be my final piece of work for the Epicodus bootcamp.  In this portfolio, I want to use my front-end abilities and combine them with some new tools to create a great UI where users will be able to see my projects and learn more about me.

## Project Description

The minimal viable product will include:
- Landing page which will serve as the entryway into the site.
- Projects page that lists my work, displays the visual layout, has quick description of each project, and a link to learn more about the project.
- Individual projects page that goes more into the concept and technologies used to build the application.
- About me page that goes into my story
- Contact page where user can fill out a form to send me a message.

## Technologies

- React
- React Router
- npm
- Sass? (Or just CSS)
- Potentially a JS or css library to help with animations (Sequence.js?)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
